Would you like to try a different number of nights? <extra_id_3> Did we not find any hotels in the expensive or moderate price range to accomodate 8 people for 4 nights starting Saturday? <extra_id_4> I searched for 4 people.

        "source": "<extra_id_3> I need a restaurant in Cambridge that has international food and a moderate price range please. <extra_id_4> The Varsity restaurant and Bloomsbury both appear to offer what you're looking for. May I book one of those for you? <extra_id_3> First, i was wondering, do these restaurants have free wifi availability? <extra_id_4> The Wifi is currently not free for Guests. Can I start a reservation? <extra_id_3> Yes please make me a reservation at the Bloomsbury for 2 people at 19:30 on Thursday. <extra_id_4> I'm sorry I wasn't able to make that booking. Would you like another day or time? <extra_id_3> How about 18:30 instead? Does that work? <extra_id_4> Yes, the booking has been completed. <extra_id_3> I am also looking for a place to stay. Are there any 5 star hotels that include free parking? <extra_id_4> Unfortunately there are no hotels that meet those preferences, would you like me to search for a 4 star instead? <extra_id_3> Yes please, but it definitely needs to be a hotel, not a guesthouse. <extra_id_4> There are three hotels that meet your preferences, would you like me to book one of them for you? <extra_id_3> Yes, that would be great. I also need the reference number for the Bloomsbury booking please. <extra_id_4> The reference number to the bloomsbury booking is NTKQ8R1I. <extra_id_3> Thank you so much. <extra_id_4> Did you want me to book that hotel for you? The Huntingdon Marriott, The Cambridge Belfry, and the University Arms all meet your requirements. <extra_id_3> I would like to book The Huntingdon Marriott on Thursday for 5 nights for the same 2 people. If it is not available, please book another one. <extra_id_4> Unfortunately booking was unsuccessful for that day. Can we try another day? <extra_id_3> Do they have a booking for one day? <extra_id_4> Yes, I was able to book the hotel for one day.  Your reference number is V1PGRO1T.  Is there anything else I can help you with? <extra_id_3> I'm also in need of a taxi to commute between the locations, can you find me one? <extra_id_4> I'd be happy to get you a taxi, will you be departing from the hotel or the restaurant? What time do you want to arrive? <extra_id_3> I'd like the taxi to pick me up from the hotel. I need to be at the restaurant at 18:30. <extra_id_4> I have booked your taxi to bloomsbury from huntingdon, Booked car type: grey volvo Contact number:\t07021736620. May I help with anything else? <extra_id_3> Can I pay for that with Master? <extra_id_4> Yes, the charge will be applied to your Mastercard. Is there anything further I can help you with? <extra_id_3> Is my Mastercard allowed to be used for the booking at the hotel? <extra_id_4> That will be fine, this hotel accepts Mastercard. Do you need anything else? <extra_id_3> No, thank you for your help.",

Can I help you with something else? <extra_id_3> That sounds perfect! Could you book me a table for friday at 18:00 for 8 people. Could you include the reference number also? <extra_id_4> I have booked your table. Your reference is ZNVPVZD5. Is there anything else I can help you with? <extra_id_3> Yes, I also need a hotel, I am on a budget so if you could find a cheap one that would be great. <extra_id_4> There are 9 guesthouses and 1 hotel that is cheap. Do you have any other criteria such as area? <extra_id_3> Not really, I don't need free parking or anything. What is available? <extra_id_4> I would recommend the Allenbell. Would you care to book a room there? <extra_id_3> I want to make sure i'll be accommodated at all hours, what are the hours for the front desk? <extra_id_4> During business hours, they do not have 24 hour services. Would you still like to make a reservation? <extra_id_3> Yes, for 2 nights for 8 people starting on Friday. <extra_id_4> I have booked you and your party for the Allenbell. Your reference number is TZ42QW4H. May I assist you with anything else? <extra_id_3> Can you confirm whether the Allenbell has a lift? <extra_id_4> There is not a lift available at the Allenbell. I'll try to make sure you're on the ground floor. Anything else? <extra_id_3> That should be everything. Thank you for all of the assistance!",
